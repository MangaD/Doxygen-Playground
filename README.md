# Welcome to My Doxygen Markdown Project

> **Note:** This repository is intended for experimenting with Doxygen in order to detect bugs and test documentation workflows.

This is the main page for your Doxygen-generated documentation. You can add more details about your project here.

## Getting Started

- Add your documentation in Markdown files.
- Run Doxygen to generate HTML documentation.

See [usage.md](usage.md) for usage instructions.

## How to Compile the Documentation

2. Open a terminal in this project directory.
3. Run the following command:

   ```sh
   doxygen Doxyfile
   ```

4. The generated HTML documentation will be available in the `docs/html` directory.
